# Functional-Discovery-of-the-Human-Gut-Microbiome-via-the-Structural-Proteome

Here we provide associated scripts and PDB files for the manuscript: Functional Discovery of the Human Gut Microbiome via the Structural Proteome.


## 1. Scripts
The scripts to analyze the data and plot the figures in the manuscript are deposed in the fold `scripts`.
Mainly including codes to do:
a. structure alignment
b. structure clustering
c. structural tree visualization
d. structural domain segmentation
<br />
<br />

## 2. The human Gut Microbial Protein Structure database (GMPS)
The human Gut Microbial Protein Structure database (GMPS) includes AlphaFold2 predicted protein structures from 1496 phage genomes and 968 bacteria genomes. The GMPS database is freely available to the public without registration or login requirements (http://siat.dthink.net:81/home/align). Users can freely download the genomes, protein sequences, and protein structures. Users can also perform BLAST-like searches (based on structure similarity, instead of sequence similarity) across microbial genomes to search for microbial proteins
with similar structures to the uploaded structural template.

## 3. The predicted protein structures from 12 type phages
Protein structures of 12 type phages predicted by AlphaFold2 can be freely downloaded from the figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26984035.v1). These well-studied phage proteins are clustered together with gut phage protein structures to infer the functions of unannotated gut phage proteins.
<br />

List of type phages:<br />
Escherichia phage P1、Escherichia phage P2、Bacteriophage P2、Enterobacteria phage P4、<br />
Enterobacteria phage T3、Escherichia phage T4、Escherichia phage T5、Escherichia phage T7<br />
Escherichia phage HK97、Escherichia phage Lambda、Escherichia phage Mu、Inovirus M13<br />
